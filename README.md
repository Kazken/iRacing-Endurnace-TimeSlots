# iRacing-Endurnace-TimeSlots

To use each script:

First you need the unicode time of the first split of the season. That can be found here: https://sesh.fyi/timestamp/

Once you get the long number, copy it, and when running the script:

python [Filename] [number] "race1" "race2" "race3"...

It will output a file with the names of all the races to allow you to copy into a text file to then add to your discord.
